## Introduction
Finding an available open study room around campus is a pain. Often we need to walk around the entire, for instance, library to find a vacant study room not to mention failing to find one is just so expected.

## Demo
This is homepage [Welcome to ROOMr.](http://gengruijie.pythonanywhere.com) <br >
The homepage is designed for our campus library. This is an almost static website. The only changeable part is state part. The different value from database will give different state of this room.

## Built with
* **Arduino and motion sensor**: to detect vacancy status of study rooms so that we can save students time finding a place to study. ROOMr might also connect lights to preserve energy. 
* **Flask with MySQL**: to develop a online system so that users can check the state of study rooms.
