# ROOMr

## Introduction
Finding an available open study room around campus is a pain. Often we need to walk around the entire, for instance, library to find a vacant study room not to mention failing to find one is just so expected.

**ROOMr** uses Arduino and motion sensor to detect vacancy status of study rooms so that we can save students time finding a place to study. ROOMr might also connect lights to preserve energy.
